EATB REPORT SOLUTIONS - FINAL SUMMARY
=====================================

PROBLEM:
--------
EATB HTML reports require drag-and-drop of the data folder due to browser 
security restrictions. The application validates data integrity using MD5 
hashes, which makes embedding data difficult.

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
-------------------
1. ❌ Embedding data with hash recalculation - Hash mismatch
2. ❌ Bypassing hash validation with JavaScript interception - Too late
3. ❌ Patching JavaScript code directly - Broke the application

WORKING SOLUTION:
-----------------
✅ LOCAL WEB SERVER (serve_eatb_report.py)

This is the ONLY reliable solution that:
- Serves files exactly as EATB expects
- No hash validation issues
- No code modifications needed
- Works perfectly every time

USAGE:
------
python3 serve_eatb_report.py evaluationResult_2025-09-22_09-33-37/

The script will:
1. Start a local web server on port 8000
2. Automatically open your browser
3. Serve the report with all data intact
4. Press Ctrl+C when done to stop the server

WHY THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION:
------------------------------
- No file modifications needed
- No hash validation problems
- Works with ANY EATB report
- Simple one-command operation
- Can be packaged as a desktop app if needed

ALTERNATIVE (if you absolutely need a single file):
---------------------------------------------------
The embedded approach doesn't work due to EATB's strict hash validation.
The only way to create a truly standalone file would be to:

1. Decompile and modify the EATB source code
2. Remove hash validation entirely
3. Recompile the application

This is not practical and would require access to EATB's source code.

RECOMMENDATION:
--------------
Use serve_eatb_report.py - it's simple, reliable, and works perfectly.

If you need to share reports with others, you can:
1. Package the Python script with the report folder
2. Create a simple batch/shell script to run it
3. Or use the original EATB drag-and-drop method

The web server approach is actually MORE convenient than drag-and-drop
because it's just one command and opens automatically.
